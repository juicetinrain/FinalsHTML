                            As a beginner in the world of programming, one of the basic programming languages we are taught is HTML.
                            I'm usually a fast learner but somehow I struggled with learning HTML as there are no error codes, and would only either show up blank or just ruin the design you have made. But with the help of academic projects and a few of my friends I was able to become fluent in it little by little.

                        <p>
                            The idea for building this website came while I was looking for anime figurines to gift a friend, then I remembered that one of the online friends I've known for 5 years sells
                            authentic anime figurines that are affordable and high quality. It is a small business ran by his dad who is an avid fan of anime and a collector of figurines as well.
                            Then a thought struck me "What if I can show my support in some other way other than buying" as I don't have a lot of spare money to spend, and so my idea of supporting them is by creating a website for them which they can use in the future if they ever want to expand on their small business.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        Making this was no easy task, as I have little to no creativity.
                        But I had friends who helped me with planning out the layout and design, as well as the important functionalities a good website should have. And within a few days I was able to finally build a website dedicated for selling anime figurines that are not only authentic, high quality, but also affordable.
